A full-stack video communication application allowing seamless peer-to-peer connectivity. This project demonstrates the implementation of low-latency media streaming and real-time data signaling.

---

## 🚀 Overview
This platform enables users to join virtual rooms and communicate via high-definition video and audio. It leverages **WebRTC** for peer-to-peer data transfer and **Socket.io** for real-time signaling between clients.

### ✨ Key Features
* **One-on-One Video Calling**: High-quality, low-latency video and audio streams.
* **Instant Messaging**: Real-time chat functionality during video sessions.
* **Dynamic Room Management**: Join specific sessions using unique Room IDs.
* **Responsive Interface**: Optimized for both mobile and desktop browsers.
